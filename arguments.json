        "argument": "Prescription drugs are something that people need to survive. The horror stories of people not being able to afford medication or the stories of someone's illness placing a massive financial burden on their lives are unfortunately far too common. In the United States in particular, health care, not just prescription drugs, are relatively so much more expensive that it can be legitimately cheaper to fly to another country to receive health services. There is even a term for this practice called, 'Medical Tourism.' The reason this is the case is for several unfortunate reasons such as lack of government regulation, inflation, etc. The bottom line is that health services and products that people genuinely need to survive and should have access to are much too expensive and inaccessible. Prescription drug importation is the practice of purchasing prescription drugs from another country and importing them to the United States. Many safety concerns would come with this practice as there is a reason that it is not allowed for unapproved drugs, but if there could be systems in place to regulate and allow prescription drugs to be imported it would be legitimately life-changing for many people in the United States. More accessible prescription drugs mean lower health care costs, which would mean lower health insurance costs. The United States is already criticized for having the highest cost of healthcare in the developed world, so something like this would go a long way in solving that problem."

        "argument": "The importation of drugs threatens safety controls and the domestic pharmaceutical industry. Drugs produced here in the U.S. are subject to strict regulations and safety protocols surrounding their manufacture, handling, and distribution. Imported drugs may not adhere to these same standards which could lead to harmful outcomes for the consumer in the form of ineffective, dangerous, or substandard products. The effects of the infiltration of substandard foreign pharmaceuticals would cause problems both for the consumer and domestic pharmaceutical companies. First, it would serve to jeopardize the health of the public at large as mentioned above. Secondly, it would more than likely serve to gradually weaken the public's trust in the efficacy of domestically produced pharmaceuticals. Imported drugs would also negatively impact the domestic pharmaceutical industry as they would likely be sold at a much lower cost than domestically produced pharmaceuticals whose high cost is largely justified by the hefty cost of R&D. This could stifle innovation in the American pharmaceutical industry as domestic pharmaceutical companies pare back their investments in R&D. This could create an inflection point wherein domestic pharmaceutical companies are unable to turn back their reduced investments in R&D in order to stay competitive with imports. Although some might be enticed by the prospect of lowered pharmaceutical prices, opening the door to increased drug importation should be a non-starter as it threatens to weaken the health of the American populace and the financial solvency of the domestic pharmaceutical industry and would almost certainly serve to lower the perceived quality of pharmaceutical drugs."

A University of California, Davis, study showed that it may be 25 times worse for the environment than pasture-raised cattle. After analyzing the CO2 emissions from the in-lab purification process, they concluded that the global warming potential of cultured meat is between four and 25 times higher than that of traditional beef. The production of lab-grown meat may require extensive energy resources, which could come from non-renewable sources, for the necessary infrastructure. To prevent environmental contamination, the bioreactors used for cultured meat generate waste that needs proper disposal. We still don't know yet if it is safe for people to eat cultured meat. The process also uses antibiotics and hazardous materials. People could be exposed to harmful bacteria or other contaminants. Studies have shown that these products contain high levels of saturated fat and cholesterol, known risk factors for heart disease. The process used to grow cultured meat is also considered unethical. The fetal bovine serum used as a growth medium for this product is taken from fetuses that do not survive the procedure. Fetal bovine serum can carry animal-borne diseases, and its use could pose significant risks if not properly handled."},

A lot of people are against genetic modification because it’s new, it’s complicated, it’s scary. People may split into Team Evolution or Team Creation, but I don't think we need to make this more complicated, because genetic modification has existed for as long as genes have been around. In the creation camp, genes are modified or created by God. In evolution, genes are modified by natural selection, and in both cases, gene changes can happen randomly when the body gets messed up like with toxic radiation. A lot of people make a fair point saying random or natural gene changes are different from willingly changing genes like we're playing god. When does a baby become a baby? For many people, life begins at the moment of conception, and many others may have different definitions or beliefs about when life begins. In the old days, people tested genetic modification on embryos and that’s the controversy. Genetic modifications could fix problems and save lives and that is another valid argument. I can’t answer that mess, but I can say there’s no good reason to genetically modify babies because doctors don’t have to use fertilized embryos to modify genes anymore. New techniques can turn any cell into a stem cell that can then turn into an egg or sperm to modify a gene before a living being is formed in reproduction. That means no umbilical cord stem cells too. If we have the technology to modify cells and people want to use it, you can argue for adults to access it when there have been more studies. We shouldn’t perform genetic modification on babies. It’s unethical and dangerous."},

        "argument": "Corporations should be required to disclose their climate impacts for several compelling reasons. Firstly, transparency fosters accountability. By publicly reporting their greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental effects, companies are held responsible for their contributions to climate change. This transparency enables consumers, investors, and regulatory bodies to make informed decisions, promoting sustainable business practices and discouraging harmful behaviors.\n\nSecondly, disclosure empowers stakeholders, including investors, who increasingly advocate for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in their investment strategies. Understanding a corporation\u2019s climate impact allows investors to allocate resources toward more sustainable companies, thus incentivizing businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices. This shift toward sustainability can result in long-term financial benefits for both corporations and investors.\n\nAdditionally, climate disclosure can drive innovation. Companies that measure and report their environmental impacts can identify areas for improvement, leading to the development of cleaner technologies and processes. This innovation not only benefits the environment but can also create competitive advantages in a market that increasingly prioritizes sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, mandating climate impact disclosure promotes accountability, empowers informed decision-making, and encourages innovation, ultimately contributing to more sustainable corporate practices and a healthier planet for future generations."

        "side": "AGAINST",
        "argument": "Requiring corporations to disclose their climate impacts may seem beneficial, but it poses several significant drawbacks. Firstly, such mandates could impose substantial compliance costs on businesses, particularly smaller firms that may not have the resources to conduct extensive environmental assessments. This might stifle innovation and lead to job losses as companies divert funds away from growth initiatives to meet regulatory requirements.\n\nMoreover, mandatory disclosure may not yield the intended transparency. Companies might focus on fulfilling the minimum legal requirements rather than genuinely engaging in meaningful sustainability practices. This could lead to a culture of \"greenwashing,\" where firms merely present an illusion of environmental responsibility without making substantial changes to their operations.\n\nAdditionally, the complexity involved in accurately measuring and reporting climate impacts might result in inconsistent data. This inconsistency could mislead investors and consumers, making it difficult to assess a company's true environmental performance. Furthermore, public release of sensitive data could expose corporations to reputational risks, even if their practices are compliant with regulations. Thus, while transparency is important, a blanket requirement for climate impact disclosure may create more problems than it solves, hindering corporate efficacy and potentially undermining genuine environmental efforts."

        "topic": "Basing decisions on credit scores and models is discriminatory and unethical.",
        "side": "FOR",
        "argument": "Basing decisions on credit scores and models can be seen as discriminatory and unethical for several compelling reasons. Firstly, these models often rely on historical data that reflects systemic inequalities in society. Factors like race, socioeconomic status, and geographic location can negatively impact an individual's credit score, regardless of their current financial behavior or ability to repay debts. This inequity can perpetuate a cycle of poverty for marginalized communities, limiting their access to essential services such as housing, education, and employment.\n\nMoreover, credit scoring models frequently fail to incorporate alternative data that presents a more holistic view of a person's financial health. Individuals who may not have established a traditional credit history, often due to reasons outside their control, can be unjustly penalized. This leads to a lack of access to opportunities for responsible individuals who might contribute positively to the economy.\n\nAdditionally, reliance on credit scores can encourage predatory lending practices, where vulnerable populations are targeted with high-interest loans, trapping them in debt. The ethical implications of such practices raise serious questions about fairness and justice in financial decision-making. By continuing to prioritize credit scores, society inadvertently endorses discriminatory practices that undermine the principle of equality."

        "side": "AGAINST",
        "argument": "Basing decisions on credit scores and models is not inherently discriminatory or unethical; rather, it serves as a pragmatic approach to assess an individual's creditworthiness. Credit scores have been established to provide a standardized, quantifiable measure of financial responsibility, helping lenders evaluate risk efficiently. The statistical nature of these models, which analyze historic data, enables lenders to make informed decisions that ultimately protect their financial interests and maintain market stability.\n\nFurthermore, credit scoring models can benefit consumers by promoting responsible financial behavior. They incentivize individuals to manage their debts wisely, leading to better financial habits and enhancing overall economic health. Additionally, the transparency of credit scoring systems allows consumers to understand how they are evaluated and offers them opportunities to improve their scores through responsible financial practices.\n\nWhile it's important to recognize that some individuals may face unfavorable outcomes due to systemic issues, attributing these effects solely to credit scoring models oversimplifies a complex problem. Efforts to educate consumers on financial literacy and access to credit can mitigate concerns regarding discrimination, fostering a more inclusive financial landscape without entirely discarding the utility and efficiency of credit scoring systems. Hence, outright condemnation of credit models overlooks their practical advantages and potential to drive positive financial behavior."

        "side": "FOR",
        "argument": "Prescription drug ads should be allowed on television as they serve to enhance public awareness and empower patients. By providing information about various medications, these advertisements educate viewers on available treatment options for various health conditions. This knowledge can encourage individuals to discuss potential therapies with their healthcare providers, fostering a proactive approach to personal health management.\n\nFurthermore, drug ads have the potential to destigmatize certain medical conditions, encouraging individuals who may have been reluctant to seek treatment to do so. By showcasing real-life stories and testimonials, these ads humanize health issues and promote openness regarding mental and physical health challenges.\n\nMoreover, the pharmaceutical industry plays a crucial role in funding medical research and development. Allowing direct-to-consumer advertising can provide essential funding for these initiatives, ultimately leading to more effective treatments and innovations in healthcare.\n\nLastly, consumers in a democratic society should have the freedom to access information about their health and potential treatment options. Regulating the content and ensuring accurate information can mitigate misinformation while preserving the right of individuals to make informed choices about their health. Encouraging an open dialogue about medications fosters a more informed, health-conscious society."

        "topic": "Prescription drug ads should be allowed on television.",
        "side": "AGAINST",
        "argument": "Prescription drug advertisements on television should not be allowed due to several concerning factors. First and foremost, these ads often prioritize marketing over health, leading to potential misinformation. By glamorizing certain medications, they can create unrealistic expectations among viewers about their efficacy and accessibility, detracting from the importance of professional medical advice. \n\nAdditionally, advertising prescription drugs fosters a direct-to-consumer marketing culture that can pressure physicians into prescribing medications that may not be necessary or appropriate for patients. This could undermine the doctor-patient relationship, where informed decisions should be based solely on a patient\u2019s unique needs rather than influence from advertisements.\n\nMoreover, the costs associated with prescription drugs are significantly impacted by these advertisements. Pharmaceutical companies often pass on the hefty expenses of advertising to consumers, resulting in higher prices for medications. This can limit access for those who genuinely need medicine, ultimately harming public health.\n\nFinally, the emotional and psychological effects of watching these ads must be considered. They can lead to anxiety and fear regarding personal health, pushing individuals to seek out drugs even when not warranted. Overall, the potential harms associated with prescription drug ads outweigh any benefits, making them ill-suited for television."
